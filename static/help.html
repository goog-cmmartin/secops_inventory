  <h2>Help & Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    This guide provides an overview of the different sections of the
    SecOps Inventory Platform.
  </p>

  <h4>Setup Tab</h4>
  <p>
    This is the main landing page where you manage your tenants. A
    tenant is typically a GCP Project that has a SecOps instance. From
    here, you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>View all discovered or manually added tenants.</li>
    <li>
      See whether a tenant has been configured with the necessary API
      credentials.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click <strong>Configure</strong> to add or update a tenant's
      details, including SecOps Customer ID, region, and API keys for
      services like SOAR and BindPlane.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click <strong>Test</strong> to verify that the application can
      successfully connect to the Chronicle API for that tenant.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Chronicle API Tab</h4>
  <p>
    This tab provides a raw interface for making ad-hoc requests to
    the Chronicle API for a selected, configured tenant. It's a useful
    tool for exploring the API or for debugging.
  </p>

  <h4>Audits Tab</h4>
  <p>
    This is where you run audits against your tenants. The process is
    simple:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select a configured tenant from the dropdown menu.</li>
    <li>
      The list of available audits will be displayed, grouped by
      category.
    </li>
    <li>Check the boxes for the audits you wish to run.</li>
    <li>
      Click <strong>Run Selected Audits</strong>. The results will
      appear in the text box below.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once you have successful audit runs, you can click
      <strong>Generate Report</strong> to create a human-readable
      summary using the AI model, or <strong>Create Schedule</strong> to set up recurring audits or reports.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Insights Tab</h4>
  <p>
    Insights allow you to correlate data from multiple different audit
    sources into a single AI-driven analysis. For example, you could
    create an Insight that looks at both Chronicle rules and SOAR
    playbooks. You can create, edit, and run Insight templates from
    this page.
  </p>

  <h4>Schedules Tab</h4>
<p>
  The Schedules tab allows you to automate repetitive tasks by creating scheduled jobs. You can define:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Schedule Name:</strong> A descriptive name for your scheduled job.</li>
  <li><strong>Tenant:</strong> The specific tenant (GCP Project) against which the schedule will run.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule Type:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Run Audits:</strong> Executes a selected set of audits.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate Report:</strong> Generates an AI-summarized report from selected audits.</li>
      <li><strong>Run Diff:</strong> Automatically compares the last two successful runs of selected audits and generates a consolidated diff report, highlighting only configuration changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Audits to Include:</strong> Which audits will be part of this schedule (relevant for all schedule types).</li>
  <li><strong>Cron Schedule:</strong> A standard cron expression to define when the job should run (e.g., "0 1 * * *" for daily at 1 AM).</li>
  <li><strong>Report Name Format (for Reports and Diffs):</strong> A customizable name format for the generated reports.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable/Disable:</strong> Toggle the schedule's active status.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Settings Tab</h4>
  <p>This tab contains advanced configuration options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>LLM Report Customization:</strong> Customize the prompt
      and exclude specific data fields for each audit before it's sent
      to the AI model for report generation. This allows you to
      fine-tune the focus of your reports.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Custom YL2 Queries:</strong> Create and manage your own
      YARA-L 2.0 queries, which will then appear as runnable audits in
      the Audits tab.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Configurable Audits:</strong> Add or modify audit
      definitions to target different APIs (Chronicle, SOAR,
      BindPlane) and endpoints.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Reports Tab</h4>
  <p>
    This page lists all the AI-generated reports you have created, including regular summaries and diff reports that highlight configuration changes. You
    can view, copy, or delete them from here.
  </p>
  <h4>MCP Assistant Tab</h4>
  <p>
    This provides a conversational AI interface for interacting with
    the application's data. You can ask it questions in natural
    language (e.g., "how many tenants are configured?") or use slash
    commands for direct tool execution (e.g.,
    <code>/list_tenants</code>).
